# sorting_algorithms_visualiser
A Sorting Algorithms Visualiser made using Pygame

## Main aim
The app aims to show ten sorting algorithms, which vary in time complexity!
The ten algorithms are Bubble sort, Cocktail sort, Heap sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick Sort, Radix sort, Selection sort, Shell sort, Tin sort;

## Structure
title_screen.py handles the Title screen logic
main_screen.py handles the Main screen logic
screen.py holds the display information
button.py is used to make a simple Button
main.py is the main file for the script

### app_operations
A Python package that holds operations used all throughout the app.

### sorting_algorithms
A Python package that holds all the sorting algorithms.
Each file contains one algorithm and its time complexity written as a comment next to the function itself.
